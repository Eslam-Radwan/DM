### Common Similarity Measures
- **Interval-scaled vectors:**
  - Euclidean distance: \( d(x,y) = $\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_j - y_j)^2}$ \)
  - Manhattan (L1) distance: \( d(x,y) = $\sum_{j=1}^{n} |x_j - y_j|$\)
  - Cosine measure: \( s(x,y) = $\frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \|y\|}$ \) (not a metric)
  - Commonly used in document clustering

### Clustering Strategies
- **Partitional (Centroid Based) clustering:**
  - Given: target number of clusters \( k \).
  - Goal: partition data set into exactly \( k \) clusters.
  - Each object must appear in exactly one cluster.

- **(Connectivity Based) Hierarchical clustering:**
  - Clustering formed by composition or decomposition.
  - History of composition / decomposition operations forms a hierarchical relationship.
	  - **Agglomerative (bottom-up) approach:**
	    - Larger clusters formed by merging smaller clusters.
	    - Usually terminates when all clusters merged (but earlier termination is possible).
	  - **Divisive (top-down) approach:**
	    - Smaller clusters formed by splitting larger clusters.
	    - Often terminates when leaf clusters contain exactly one element (but earlier termination is possible).

- **Density-based clustering:**
  - Clusters grow into regions of high density.
  - Density usually computed over neighbourhoods of fixed size.
  - Connectivity constraints can be similar to those of agglomerative clustering.
  - Local criteria for growth → non-spherical clusters.
  - Minimum density criterion → noise & outlier elimination.

- **(Distribution) Model-based clustering:**
  - Guess a model explaining the data distribution.
  - Find the best fit of data to clusters as explained by the model.
  - Can lead to automatic determination of number of clusters.
  - Determination of noise & outliers according to the model.
  - Sometimes confused with classification when the model is learned from a training set.

### Hierarchical Methods
- **Agglomerative vs Divisive:**
  - **Agglomerative (bottom-up) approach:**
    - Basic method: AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting), Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1990.
    - Initially, each object in its own cluster.
    - At each step, two clusters are merged.
    - Choice of clusters according to distance criterion.
  - **Divisive (top-down) approach:**
    - Basic method: DIANA (Divisive Analysis), Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1990.
    - Initially, all objects in a single cluster.
    - At each step, a cluster is split into two.
    - Choice of cluster according to a distance criterion between the two clusters generated by the split.

### Dendrogram
- Dendrogram: Tree structure describing merge / split history.
- **Agglomerative Steps (AGNES):**
  - Example: split/merge according to closest pair of cluster members.
  - "Single-linkage" strategy.
- **Divisive Steps (DIANA):**

### Inter-Cluster Distance
- Common measures:
  - Minimum distance (single linkage): \( $d_{\text{min}}(A,B) = \min d(a,b)$ \)
  - Maximum distance (complete linkage): \( $d_{\text{max}}(A,B) = \max d(a,b)$ \)
  - Average distance: \( $d_{\text{avg}}(A,B) = \frac{1}{|A| \cdot |B|} \sum_{a \in A, b \in B} d(a,b)$ \)

### Merge / Split Strategies
- **Single Linkage:**
  - Also called Nearest Neighbour.
  - Minimum-distance measure.
  - Links determined by only two closest objects.
  - Expected merges can lead to chaining.
  - Excessive chaining can produce incoherent clusters.

- **Complete Linkage:**
  - Also called Farthest Neighbour.
  - Maximum-distance measure: \( $d_{\text{max}}(A,B) = \max d(a,b)$ \).
  - Links determined by only two farthest objects.
  - Merge order highly influenced by noise.
  - Clusters produced are more rounded, compact.

- **Average Linkage:**
  - Compromise between minimum and maximum distance.
  - Quadratic number of distances computed.
  - Less affected by noise.
  - Less prone to chaining problems: \( $d_{\text{avg}}(A,B) = \frac{1}{|A| \cdot |B|} \sum_{a \in A, b \in B} d(a,b)$ \).
